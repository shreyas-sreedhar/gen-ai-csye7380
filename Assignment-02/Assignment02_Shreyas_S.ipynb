              "[Document(metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}, page_content=\"Okay, so there were rumors. There were serious rumors that the 10th generation Apple Watch is going to be the one that gets this huge redesign. Like remember the iPhone 10, that sort of reset the design language of the whole iPhone line? And 10 is just such a nice round even number, right? So we just kind of figured that maybe the Apple Watch would do the same thing. And I even remember in my last few years of reviewing the Apple Watch Series 8, Series 9, I was like, look, these are good watches. But clearly very incremental improvements. So if you want a big upgrade, maybe wait till the 10th Gen 1. And so now here we are. I've been using Apple Watch Series 10 for the past week. And it's definitely another incremental upgrade. Now, you know, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Obviously, it's not as exciting as a total redesign. But that definitely makes this review pretty simple as far as whether you should get one or not. The main physical differences this time on the outside are it's slightly thinner and lighter and bigger. So the numbers say 10% thinner and 10% lighter for the aluminum one. And then they actually dropped stainless steel in favor of titanium on the higher end ones. So that's 20% lighter. And the screens of both sizes are now even bigger. And the result is really just that you can see more and it's just more comfortable on the wrist. In fact, it actually just feels like someone took last year's Apple Watch and just squashed it down a little bit. And there you go. That's the new design. And of course, it's more complicated than that. Like, there is a new metal back that's one piece now and there's a new re-engineered speaker that's 30% smaller. So it can fit in this and just other pieces like shuffled around to fit in this new shape. But the end result is very much still an incremental update instead of some dramatic new form factor. I actually think now this visually reminds me more than ever of a Pixel Watch. Just depending on what face you have. Just because of the way the top edges are curved even more and the way everything just kind of melts into the sides, especially with this new jet black color, it's just way bigger. In fact, it's true. The larger 46 millimeter Apple Watch series 10 basically now runs the same screen size as the Apple Watch Ultra. And Apple loves to do that thing where they show an older watch on the screen and then the newer watch with a bigger screen next to it and brag about how, hey, there's a bigger screen so you can get even more text and even more content on the screen and it's easier to type on that on screen keyboard. And to be honest, it never really made that much of a big difference to me other than maybe the ultra. But this year, I noticed something very specific. The disc sports workout now shows one extra line of information. So instead of time, active calories, total calories and heart rate, it now shows me time, active calories, total calories, heart rate and miles. So there's that. I think WatchOS 11 literally just adds an extra line of text and sentences with these bigger screens, which is kind of funny. But speaking of WatchOS 11, that launches on these new watches and gets pushed as a software update to some older Apple watches. So you're going to get things like the new Vitals app, which gives you a sort of energy score, kind of like the Garmin body battery. And there is a sleep apnea detection, which just got FDA approval to detect and notify you of potentially high levels of sleep apnea using only the accelerometer. And there's training load as well, which keeps track of the perceived intensity of workouts. That stuff is nice. And it's also like I said, coming to some older Apple Watches as well. So if you really want to know what stuff is specifically coming just to this newest watch, so like a reason to get this one, then there's about four that you should know about. Okay. Let me know if these are enough to convince you to get this newest watch. So number one, with this redesign speaker, you can now listen to media out loud on the watch. So meaning like you could already like take phone calls and set alarms and stuff, but now you can literally just play media like music or podcasts or audiobooks out loud. So you could be on a hike and just forget your headphones and just you could be that guy, but don't. Don't be that guy. So the number two, this is now an updated LTPO 3 display, which means it'll go all the way down to one hertz instead of 10 hertz. So now it can show the second hand all the time when the always on display is on because it doesn't take up extra battery. Plus it has slightly noticeably better off-axis viewing angles, which actually helps for a watch. So you can sort of glance and check the watch and still see it without looking like you're checking your watch. Because in the number three, there is a new water temperature sensor. So here's a thing. I don't know if you can tell by looking at me, but I don't really spend too much time around deep water. So I don't have any test results for this particular new sensor, but it's there now. So great. But then number four, faster charging. So cared about this one turns out, so if you use the puck that comes with it, this is how you maximize your charging speed. You can now get it up to somewhere around 65% from dead in half an hour. It's supposed to be 80% actually, but we couldn't get it quite that fast. But nevertheless, the faster charging speed is very welcome. And that's it. That's the new big 10th generation update. There's also the new S10 Sip inside, which doesn't seem to be noticeably faster or better at anything in the S9. It hasn't improved neural engine, but hasn't been enabling anything that the S9 can't do. Yeah, is that enough? And the more I thought about it, honestly, my take is that now that Apple has called this a redesign, like if you watch the keynote, they were like, this is, there's a huge deal. This is the big new 10th generation redesign. Now that they've done that, I'm fairly sure that that means that this is what the Apple Watch is going to look like for the next five to 10 more years. Like this, if this is a real redesign for Apple, then we're going to be back to even smaller changes from here on. Really the only parts of this update that made a big difference at all to me are the larger display and faster charging. The largest play for obvious reasons. The faster charging is nice, especially just because if you want to drop it on a charger for a few minutes and get a bunch of use, then you can. I would find it even better if I was doing sleep tracking as well, but I've mentioned this before I'm not because I'm using the 8th sleep for all my sleep tracking metrics. And so shout out to 8th sleep for sponsoring this portion of the video. The 8th sleep has been so good to me, which is why I'm mentioning it in previous videos. And you've already heard about this new one, the Pod4 Ultra, which can get super cool or super warm to each side of the bed independently. But also, yeah, it's doing that biometric tracking with 99% accuracy, no matter how you're sleeping, which I think is actually an advantage over something on the back of your wrist. So then you just jump in the app and you can see, you know, here's the different stages of sleep here. I've been waking up in the middle of the night randomly since coming back from Australia's time zone, but this is a pretty good night right here. You can see heart rate, heart rate variability, breath rate, no snoring, which is great. And it's helping me get back into my sleep routine here on the East Coast. And it can help anyone sleep better, honestly. So you just add the pod to your current mattress, like a fitted sheet, and it automatically cools down or warms up each side of the bed. So you can go to 8th sleep.com slash MKBHD and get $350 off Pod4 Ultra or 200 bucks off the pod for. And then you can also leave your wearable on the nightstand. But okay, so if you have an older Apple Watch series four, five, six, seven, and you want a new one, then, okay, yeah, this is the upgrade to get. That's like the easiest no brainer conclusion in the world for this product. But I'm going, I'm going the extra step as a reviewer and predicting the future of this product and just based on Apple's language and their presentations, I really don't think we're getting any planned big upgrades to this watch for a while, which is unfortunate. But like all those major features we are thinking about, like a rotating bezel or a circular shape or a meaningful improvement to the battery, any of which would have been the biggest change to the Apple Watch in years, we didn't get any of that with this 10th Gen redesign. So it feels like they're not planning on doing any of it. So this is the 10th Gen Apple Watch and this feels like Apple's big statement of this is the Apple Watch. It's the squircle, no rotating bezel. These are the buttons. This is the shape, each and our battery life over and over again. Take it or leave it. That's it. That's the review. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace.\")]"
